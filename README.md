# stocking, a music player interface

a web interface for musicbee, the music app, that offers a much prettier
and cute look (in mine and my friends' objectively accurate opinions).
it's named after the character stocking :3 
try it out for yourself if you want, it's not complete yet - far from it.

## what's the rundown?

stocking makes use of a few different 'tunnels' let's say:
- a musicbee IPC plugin that interfaces to various languages
- a python library that can interact with the IPC
- eel, another python library, which allows interfacing between python and js

a lot of this was written in 2 days (one i didnt sleep) with slight help from the extremely minimal documentation provided with the python library (which is also now discontinued - fun). it like works and that's a miracle.
